Build for MacOS
1) Build the jar file from LibGDX
2) Create a new directory (name it whatever you want) and create a dir with the name dir inside it
3) Put the jar file inside the libs folder
4) Open terminal from the directory (the one with the whatever name) and run the 2 commands

Build runtime
jlink --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH --output ./runtime

Build smaller runtime
jlink --add-modules ALL-MODULE-PATH --output ./runtime --strip-debug --no-man-pages --no-header-files --compress=2

Build application
jpackage --dest ./dist --input ./libs --name "Blade Jumper" --main-class com.thestbar.ludumdare54.DesktopLauncher --main-jar ./desktop-1.0.jar --runtime-image ./runtime --java-options -XstartOnFirstThread

Note: The first time a MacOS user tries to launch the application it will crash and OS will try to delete
      the file. The message will look like "AppName is damages and can't be opened. You should move it to the Bin".
      DO NOT DELETE the file, instead just click Cancel (or Close) and go in System Settings -> Privacy & Security
      and on the Security section you will find a message that says "AppName was blocked from use because it is not
      from an identified developer" and below this message a button with the label Open Anyway exists. Click this button
      and try again to open the Application. It is mandatory on the same Security section in Settings, the user to have
      selected under "Allow application downloaded from" the value "App Store and identified developers".
